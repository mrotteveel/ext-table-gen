Individual source files are annotated with SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
instead of the Apache boiler plate notice (which is included below). See also
<https://apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#My-License>.

If files have a different annotation, they are licensed with that license. If a
file has no SPDX annotation (inside the file, or in <filename>.license or in
REUSE.toml), assume the SPDX is NOASSERTION.
