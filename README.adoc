= ext-table-gen: Firebird External Table Generator

The "`Firebird External Table Generator`" or _ext-table-gen_ is a commandline tool to convert https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180[RFC 4180^] CSV files to https://www.firebirdsql.org/[Firebird^] external tables (a binary format for Firebird external table data).

External tables are a good way for bulk-loading data into Firebird.
Unfortunately, external tables use a fixed-width _binary_ format, and not a (more) standard format like CSV.
It is not always easy to create an appropriate external table file, and this is where _ext-table-gen_ can be used.

At a high level, _ext-table-gen_ provides the following features:

* Derive a `CHAR`-based external table definition (i.e. a `CREATE TABLE` statement and a configuration for _ext-table-gen_) from a CSV file
* Transform a CSV file to an external table file (either based on the CSV file itself, or based on a configuration file)

The current version only supports `CHAR` columns, which makes the generated file essentially a fixed-width text format.
Future versions may introduce support for additional column types.
