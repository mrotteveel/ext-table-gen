* Project-Specification

== Description

The project `nl.lawinegevaar.fdb:ext-table-gen` -- or "`Firebird External Table Generator`" -- is a commandline tool to generate Firebird external table files from CSV files.

The tool will initially have the following features and limitations:

* The tool will only import CSV files in the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180[RFC 4180 format^], optionally with a header row
* The external table generated will be fixed-width text (using all `CHAR` columns)
* The tool will -- optionally -- accept a configuration file with column types, exact format TBD
* If no column types were specified (see previous item), the tool will create a separate file with column types required for the external table definition, with the same configuration file format as the previous item
* The tool will only read from and to actual files, so not from the standard in or to the standard out)
* All conversational output of the tool is written to standard error
* The tool can -- optionally, but by default -- generate a "`line-break`" column with either LF or CRLF as content
* Column length overflow results in an error (only applies when column length is determined by configuration)
* Column count overflow results in an error (column count is determined by first row, or by configuration)
* Column count underflow results in an error (column count is determined by first row, or by configuration)

== Future Plans

The following are ideas for things to implement in the future.
These are not guaranteed to arrive, but during implementation it might be helpful to consider these to not paint yourself in a corner.

* Make the project also usable as a library
* Support more or all data types of the full binary format of external tables
* Configuration of the CSV format
* Importing from stdin
* Exporting to stdout
* More input format types (e.g. JSON, XML, Excel)
* Convert an external table `CREATE TABLE` to the configuration file format
* Convert a configuration file to an (example) `CREATE TABLE` statement
* Configurable column length overflow handling (e.g. truncate)

However, keep in mind, too much consideration for future plans may lead to an overcomplicated design or things that aren't actually going to be used.
