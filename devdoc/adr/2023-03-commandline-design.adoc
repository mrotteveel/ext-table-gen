== Status

* Published: 2023-06-23

== Type

* Feature-Specification

== Context

The "`Firebird External Table Generator`" is intended to be used as a commandline tool, and as such needs a commandline API to function.

== Decision

The primary API will be defined in long-form commandline options, using kebab-case naming (e.g. `--input-file`).
Naming should be explicit and descriptive, but succinct.
Initially, no short-form options will be defined (e.g. `-i` or `-in`).

Options should have no overloaded meaning.
For example, the option to specify a configuration file to read should be separate from the option to specify the configuration file to generate based on the input file.

All parameters will be handled as options, there are no positional arguments or commands (this may be modified in the future).

== Consequences

A suitable commandline parser library (e.g. picocli or commons-cli) will need to be selected to implement the commandline API.
This document does not specify which library will be used, and it may change when the need arises.
