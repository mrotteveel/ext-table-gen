== Context

This documentation describes how to handle XML schema versioning.
This should have been thought of before releasing _ext-table-gen_ version 1.0, but unfortunately I only thought of it after publishing the release.

Currently, _ext-table-gen_ uses XSD `ext-table-gen-1.0.xsd` (namespace `https://www.lawinegevaar.nl/xsd/ext-table-gen-1.0.xsd`).
The namespace specifies a version.
Unfortunately, creating a new namespace for each schema change is rather painful.
With a new namespace/schema, the application can't simply read configuration files from older schemas, and would require some form of probing and loading for a specific schema version, or transformation (e.g. using XSLT) to the latest schema version.

This document describes the schema versioning rules the project will apply in an attempt to avoid namespace changes unless absolutely necessary.
This document is based on the ideas expressed in https://www.xfront.com/Versioning.pdf[^].

We only aim at being able to load documents from previous versions, and given we currently haven't enabled validation on JAXB, this might give us a bit more leeway.

== Decision

We strive to avoid changing the namespace unless absolutely necessary.
This means that -- where possible -- changes should be additive only (e.g. new elements, attributes, extensions to enumerated lists, etc.), and not invalidate existing documents.

Minor incompatible changes (i.e. validating an old document against the new schema version will fail, for example adding a required attribute) should be avoided, but in motivated cases, we can deviate from that (as long as the JAXB definition in _ext-table-gen_ can load the old document).

Major incompatible changes (e.g. removing elements, attributes, or removing values from enumerated lists, moving elements around, etc.) should be avoided where possible, but must result in a new namespace, with an upgrade path (the exact upgrade path will be considered/designed when the need arises).

From _ext-table-gen_ version 2.0, the `https://www.lawinegevaar.nl/xsd/ext-table-gen-1.0.xsd` schema/namespace will be versioned:

* The schema of _ext-table-gen_ version 1.0 will be considered version 1.0
* The version number inside the schema is entirely separate from the version number in the namespace (e.g. `ext-table-gen-1.0.xsd` could have a version 10.0)
* Between releases, minor changes will increment the minor version, and major changes, or minor, but incompatible changes will increment the major version (and reset the minor to zero).
+
The determination what is considered major or minor is left open to the one making the change, but reasoning should be documented in the ADR.

This version is recorded as follows:

* The schema itself will get a `version` attribute with its version.
* The `extTableGenConfig` root element will get a required `version` attribute recording the schema version used to create it.
+
This is a minor incompatible change, which will make validation of old documents fail.
JAXB should be able to read the document, and the `null` value of the property will be considered to mean the value is `1.0`.
This assumption will need to be verified, and if proven false, this may need to be rethought (e.g. add it as an optional attribute with default value `1.0`).

Where possible, compatibility with documents of older versions should be checked with tests.
For these tests, valid output of the released _ext-table-gen_ with a schema version is considered sufficient.
We will not test incomplete or partially populated XML for compatibility.

== Consequences

Given the minor incompatible change of the addition of the required `version` attribute, the version of the `ext-table-gen-1.0.xsd` will change to 2.0 as a result of this ADR.

Tests will need to be created with a version 1.0 document.
