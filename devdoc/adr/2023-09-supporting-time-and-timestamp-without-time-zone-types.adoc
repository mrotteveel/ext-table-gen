== Context

In addition to `DATE` (covered by https://github.com/mrotteveel/ext-table-gen/blob/main/devdoc/adr/2023-08-supporting-date-type.adoc[ADR 2023-08]), Firebird supports four other datetime types:

. `TIME [WITHOUT TIME ZONE]` -- the optional `WITHOUT TIME ZONE` fragment was introduced in Firebird 4.0
. `TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIME ZONE]` -- the optional `WITHOUT TIME ZONE` fragment was introduced in Firebird 4.0
. `TIME WITH TIME ZONE` -- introduced in Firebird 4.0
. `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` -- introduced in Firebird 4.0

This ADR only covers the first two `WITHOUT TIME ZONE` types.

These two types represent time of day or date and time of day, without time zone information.
In Java, these are best represented by `java.time.LocalTime` and `java.time.LocalDateTime`.

A `TIME` is represented as a 32-bit integer with elapsed "`fractions`" since midnight, where "`fractions`" are a unit of 100 microseconds.

In Jaybird, the time is currently encoded as:

[source,java]
----
public static final int FRACTIONS_PER_SECOND = 1000 * FRACTIONS_PER_MILLISECOND;
public static final int FRACTIONS_PER_MINUTE = 60 * FRACTIONS_PER_SECOND;
public static final int FRACTIONS_PER_HOUR = 60 * FRACTIONS_PER_MINUTE;

public int getEncodedTime() {
    return hour * FRACTIONS_PER_HOUR
           + minute * FRACTIONS_PER_MINUTE
           + second * FRACTIONS_PER_SECOND
           + fractions;
}
----

Where `fractions` is the number of sub-second fractions.
The resulting `int` is then encoded as a 32-bit integer (same as the `INTEGER` data type).

It is possible that a simpler calculation can be achieved using a custom `TemporalAccessor` implementation.

Just like `INTEGER`, a `TIME` value is aligned at 4 bytes in the external table file.

A `TIMESTAMP` is a composite type, consisting of a `DATE` part (see ADR 2023-08) and a `TIME` part (see above), and is aligned at 8 bytes.

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] standard defines a number of formats for time and date and time.

For time, the most common ISO 8601 format is the extended time format, which specifies (among others) `Thh:mm:ss.sss` and `hh:mm:ss.sss` (using 24-hours), or in Java `DateTimeFormatter` syntax: `['T']HH:mm:ss.SSS`.
The 3 digits for fractional seconds here are just illustrative, the standard does not specify exactly how many it should use (for Firebird 4 would be the maximum).
The `T` is specified in the standard, but -- in our experience -- rarely seen in practice for time-only values.

For datetime, the most common ISO 8601 format is a combination of date and time separated by `T`, or -- in Java `DateTimeFormatter` pattern syntax -- `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS`.

The SQL standard defines an alternative of ISO 8601 format with a space instead of a `T`: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`.

The Java `DateTimeFormatter` predefined instances offer more flexibility than the pattern syntax.
For example, `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME` allows 0 to 9 digits for fractional seconds, while the pattern format only supports a fixed number (corresponding to the number of `S` in the pattern).

ADR 2023-08 defined the `parseDatetime` element for parsing datetime values, and this can be reused for both `TIME` and `TIMESTAMP`.

== Decision

_ext-table-gen_ will support the `TIME` and `TIMESTAMP` data types.
These types will only be available by editing the configuration file, they will not be derived automatically by parsing the CSV.

=== `TIME`

In the XML config, the data type `TIME` will be represented by element `time`.

In Java, this data type will be represented by the type `FbTime`.
For flexibility, the Java type will hava a target type of `java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor` instead of only `java.time.LocalTime`.
Requirements may be refined in the future.

The default format used for parsing string values to time will be the ISO 8601 extended time format (`++HH:mm[:ss[.SSSS]]++`, or more specifically `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME`, which allows fraction digits between 0 and 9 instead of a fixed number).

=== `TIMESTAMP`

In the XML config, the data type `TIMESTAMP` will be represented by element `timestamp`.

In Java, this data type will be represented by the type `FbTime`.
For flexibility, the Java type will hava a target type of `java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor` instead of only `java.time.LocalDateTime`.
Requirements may be refined in the future.

The default format used for parsing string values to datetime will be the ISO 8601 combined format of date and extended time format (`++yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm[:ss[.SSSS]]++`, or more specifically `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME`, which allows fraction digits between 0 and 9 instead of a fixed number).

We'll also define an additional named formatter `SQL_TIMESTAMP`, which supports the SQL `TIMESTAMP` syntax (`++yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm[:ss[.SSSS]]++`), but allowing 0 to 9 digits of fractional seconds (again, Firebird only supports 4, but this offers the most flexibility for ingesting source data).

=== Shared Concerns

Other parsing or conversion options can be configured using the `converter` element of the datatype, following the ADR 2023-07 and 2023-08 design.
Specifically, configuration of parsing is available via the converter element `parseDatetime`.

== Consequences

The documentation must be updated to explain how to use this new data type, and to describe the configuration changes.

See also previous section for some implementation consequences.

As we cannot detect whether a pattern can fulfill the requirements of a data type, any errors for missing information will only be reported when writing the external table file.
