== Status

* Published: 2023-08-24
* Implemented in: 2.0
* Depends on: 2023-06, 2023-07

== Type

* Feature-Specification

== Context

Firebird provides two data types for exact numeric, fixed point values:

* `NUMERIC[(__precision__ [, __scale__])]`
* `DECIMAL[(__precision__ [, __scale__])]`

Both _precision_ and _scale_ are optional, though _precision_ is required if _scale_ is specified.
For both, the default _precision_ is 9, and default _scale_ is 0.

The _precision_ specifies the minimum supported digits.footnote:[This is the SQL standard behaviour for `DECIMAL`, for `NUMERIC`, the SQL standard defines that _precision_ is the maximum allowed digits]

In practice, in Firebird, these types behave virtually identical, except there is a difference in the backing data type for small values of _precision_:

* `NUMERIC`
** 1 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 4 -> `SHORT`
** 5 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 9 -> `INTEGER`
** 10 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 18 -> ``BIGINT``footnote:dl1bigint[In dialect 1, `DOUBLE PRECISION`]
** 19 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 38 -> `INT128` (since Firebird 4.0)
* `DECIMAL`
** 1 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 9 -> `INTEGER`
** 10 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 18 -> ``BIGINT``footnote:dl1bigint[]
** 19 ++<=++ precision ++<=++ 38 -> `INT128` (since Firebird 4.0)

Although Firebird records the precision, it does not constrain values by that precision.
Instead, the limits of the backing data type are used.
So, `NUMERIC(1)` -- `NUMERIC(4)` all behave the same, as do `NUMERIC(5)` -- `NUMERIC(9)` and `DECIMAL(1)` -- `DECIMAL(9)`, etc.

The actual precision is slightly higher than listed, because Firebird allows the full range of values supported by the backing datatype.
That means a `NUMERIC(4)` can actually store 5 digits, as long as the value is between -32,768 and 32,767, etc.

The _scale_ specifies the number of fractional digits (or, digits after the decimal point), and is constrained by _precision_.
In other words, _scale_ ++<=++ _precision_.

The decimal value is stored by shifting the decimal point by the __scale__ to an unscaled integer, and on load it shifts the decimal point by -_scale_ to obtain the decimal value.

When rounding (e.g. when casting a `NUMERIC(9,3)` to a `NUMERIC(9,2)`), Firebird applies "`half up`" rounding.

In external tables, the `NUMERIC` and `DECIMAL` types follow the alignment rules of their backing data type (i.e. `SHORT` -- 2 bytes, `INTEGER` -- 4 bytes, `BIGINT` and `INT128` -- 8 bytes).

The https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180[RFC 4180 format^] does not specify specific handling for or formats of dates.

Formats of numbers are (or can be) locale-sensitive, especially for things like decimal separator and grouping symbols.

Java provides the `java.text.NumberFormat` class (or more specifically, `java.text.DecimalFormat`) for parsing numbers in a locale-sensitive manner.
A locale-specific instance can be obtained with `NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale)`.

A standard for locale language tags is https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt[BCP 47^].
Java supports this through `Locale.forLanguageTag(String)` and `Locale.toLanguageTag()`.

== Decision

_ext-table-gen_ will add support for `NUMERIC` and `DECIMAL`.
This type will only be available by editing the configuration file, it will not be derived automatically by parsing the CSV.

In the XML config, the data type will be represented by elements `numeric` and `decimal`.
These elements will have the following attributes:

* `precision` (required) -- allowed value between 1 and 38
+
The implementation will apply the same rules as Firebird and ignore precision other than to use it to infer the backing data type and validate _scale_.
Actual imposed value range depends on the backing data type.
* `scale` (required) -- allowed value between 0 and _precision_ (not enforced by XSD)
* `roundingMode` (optional) -- specifies the rounding mode to apply for numbers with a higher scale than _scale_;
defaults to `HALF_UP`
+
Supported rounding modes are those provided by Java's `java.math.RoundingMode` as of Java 17 (i.e. `CEILING`, `DOWN`, `FLOOR`, `HALF_DOWN`, `HALF_EVEN`, `HALF_UP`, `UNNECESSARY`, `UP`).
Use of rounding mode `UNNECESSARY` will reject values with a higher scale than _scale_ if rounding is needed.

In Java code, the types will be represented by `FbNumeric` and `FbDecimal`.

The default conversion applied will use the constructor https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)[`BigDecimal(String)`^], meaning the format is not locale-sensitive.
Other parsing or conversion options can be configured using the `converter` element of the datatype, following the ADR 2023-07 design.

Configuration of parsing is available via the converter element `parseBigDecimal`.
This element has the following attribute:

* `locale` (required) -- locale for locale-sensitive parsing.
The BCP 47 language tag of the desired locale.
+
Contrary to parsing of dates, we decided to make the locale required to avoid ambiguity when running the same configuration on different machines.
The locale is not relevant for a lot of datetime patterns, but is relevant for parsing numbers.

At this time, we have decided not to provide a way to specify a pattern, and instead we'll use the default patterns provided by Java.
This decision may be revisited at a later time.

The `parseBigDecimal` converter in its current incarnation cannot parse numbers in scientific notation (this would require explicit configuration with a pattern, which we don't support), while the _default_ converter does.

Empty or blank values from the CSV will be interpreted as value `0`.
Other values not matching the rules of `BigDecimal(String)` or the locale-specific `NumberFormat` will produce an error.
Unscaled values outside the range of the backing data type will produce an error.
Validation of format and range will only happen while writing the external table.

We will not implement support for the dialect 1 variant of `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` with precision between 10 and 18 (i.e. backed by a scaled `DOUBLE PRECISION` instead of a `BIGINT`).
Dialect 1 has been deprecated for 20+ years.

== Consequences

The documentation must be updated to explain how to use this new data type, and to describe the configuration changes.

See also previous section for some implementation consequences.
