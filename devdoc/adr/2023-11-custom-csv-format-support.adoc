== Type

* Feature-Specification

== Context

The project initially implemented support for https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180[RFC 4180^] CSV format only.
However, there are a lot of other CSV formats out there, and offering more flexibility will be useful for people who need to import CSVs from sources which don't comply with RFC 4180.

The OpenCSV library used by the project offers two CSV parsers, `RFC4180Parser` and `CSVParser`.
The project currently uses `RFC4180Parser` with the default configuration.

The `RFC4180Parser` (through `RFC4180ParserBuilder`) supports the following configuration options:

* `quoteChar` -- the character used to quote CSV values, and to escape itself within a quoted value (default is `"`)
* `separator` -- the character used to separate CSV values (default is `,`)
* `fieldAsNull` a.k.a. `nullFieldIndicator` -- if empty or empty quoted values should be considered `null` instead of empty string (default is `NEITHER`)

The `CSVParser` (through `CSVParserBuilder`) supports the following configuration options:

* `quoteChar` -- the character used to quote CSV values (default is `"`)
* `separator` -- the character used to separate CSV values (default is `,`)
* `escapeChar` -- the character used to escape characters in a CSV value (default is `\`)
* `ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace` -- if true, ignores spaces in front of a quote (default is `true`)
* `ignoreQuotations` -- if true, quotes are ignored (default is `false`)
* `strictQuotes` -- if true, characters outside quotes are ignored (default is `false`)
* `errorLocale` -- the locale for error messages (default is JVM default locale)
* `fieldAsNull` a.k.a. `nullFieldIndicator` -- if empty or empty quoted values should be considered `null` instead of empty string (default is `NEITHER`)

Given _ext-table-gen_ treats null and empty values the same -- as Firebird external tables do not support SQL `NULL` -- the `fieldAsNull` setting is not relevant for us.

In addition, a `CSVReader` can have additional configuration, mostly surrounding multi-line CSV records, but we'll ignore that for now (though we internally use its `skipLines` setting for testing purposes).

Some characters are not easily representable on the command line (e.g. tab, and backslash, or double/single quotes can have their own problems depending on the commandline interpreter or shell).

== Decision

_ext-table-gen_ will allow configuration of the `quoteChar` and `separator` for the default RFC 4180 parser.

In addition, _ext-table-gen_ will allow selecting the more general CSV parser, allowing configuration of the properties `escapeChar`, `quoteChar`, `separator`, `ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace`, `ignoreQuotations`, and `strictQuotes`.

The parsers can be selected and configured both on the commandline and in the XML.

When overriding the parser from the XML through the commandline, applicable properties are copied from the original parser configuration to the new parser configuration.

== Consequences

The XML configuration is extended, as are the available commandline options.

The documentation needs to be updated to include the new configuration options.

=== XML Configuration

For XML configuration, the `csvFile` element adds an optional child element, which is either `rfc4180CsvParser` or `customCsvParser`.
Absence of this child element implies `rfc4180CsvParser` with its default configuration.

The element `rfc4180CsvParser` supports the following attributes:

[horizontal]
`quoteChar`:: quote character (single character, mnemonic, or Unicode escape)
`separator`:: separator (single character, mnemonic, or Unicode escape)

The element `customCsvParser` supports the following attributes:

[horizontal]
`escapeChar`:: escape character (single character, mnemonic, or Unicode escape)
`quoteChar`:: quote character (single character, mnemonic, or Unicode escape)
`separator`:: separator (single character, mnemonic, or Unicode escape)
`ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace`:: ignore leading white space (boolean)
`ignoreQuotations`:: ignore quotation (boolean)
`strictQuotes`:: strict quotes (boolean)

All attributes are optional, and the XSD will not define default values.
Absence of an attribute means the property will not be explicitly configured, applying the default of OpenCSV.

For the character attributes, any value that is not a single character, a mnemonic or a Unicode escape will be rejected with an error.
This will not be enforced by the XSD.

=== Commandline Configuration

The following commandline options are added:

`--csv-parser=++{RFC_4180|CUSTOM}++`::
Specifies the desired parser, case-insensitive.
Default value is `RFC_4180` if `--config-in` is not specified.

`--csv-quote-char=__CHARACTER__`::
Specifies the quote character.
Default defers to OpenCSV default of the parser (`"`), unless specified in XML config.

`--csv-separator=__CHARACTER__`::
Specifies the separator character.
Default defers to OpenCSV default of the parser (`,`), unless specified in XML config.

`--csv-escape-char=__CHARACTER__`::
Specifies the escape character (`CUSTOM` only).
Default defers to the OpenCSV default of the parser (`\` for `CUSTOM` only), unless specified in XML config.

`--[no-]csv-ignore-leading-white-space`::
Specifies to ignore leading white space (`CUSTOM` only)
Default defers to the OpenCSV default of the parser (`true` for `CUSTOM` only), unless specified in XML config.

`--[no-]csv-ignore-quotations`::
Specifies to ignore quotations or not (`CUSTOM` only).
Default defers to the OpenCSV default of the parser (`false` for `CUSTOM` only), unless specified in XML config.

`--[no-]csv-strict-quotes`::
Specifies strict quotes behaviour (`CUSTOM` only).
Default -- when not specified -- defers to the OpenCSV default of the parser (`false` for `CUSTOM` only)

Where __CHARACTER__ is either a single character, a mnemonic, or a Unicode escape.

Options which are not supported by the selected parser will log a warning, but will not terminate the application.

=== Mnemonics

Mnemonics are names for characters that are not -- or not easily -- representable in the commandline or in XML (or both).
All mnemonics listed below (or added at a later time) are supported both by the commandline and the XML config.
They will be handled case-insensitive.

The supported mnemonics are:

[horizontal]
`TAB`:: horizontal tab (Unicode U+0009)
`SPACE`:: space (Unicode U+0020)
`QUOT`:: quotation mark/double quote (``"``, Unicode U+0022)
`APOS`:: apostrophe/single quote (``'``, Unicode U+0027)
`GRAVE`:: grave accent/back tick (``{backtick}``, Unicode U+0060)

Mnemonics are derived from the well-known ASCII name of the character, or the XML or HTML entity names, if such an entity exists for a character.
Mnemonics must be at least two characters long, and cannot start with `U+`.
For characters not in ASCII or without an HTML entity name, we'll need to come up with a rule if and when we add such a mnemonic.

The mnemonics are preserved in the configuration, but may be normalized.
That is, if a mnemonic is specified on the commandline, that mnemonic will be stored in the XML config.
If the XML config has a mnemonic, it will be stored when the XML config is written out again.
Mnemonics will be normalized to their uppercase variant when the XML config is written out.

If the parser type is switched from _CUSTOM_ to _RFC_4180_, only the properties applicable to _RFC_4180_ will be stored.

=== Unicode Escape

The Unicode escape allows any Unicode codepoint to be encoded.

The syntax is `++U+hhhh++` (e.g. `U+0020` for space).
We don't support 5 hex digit escapes, as OpenCSV expects a `char`, which by its very nature only supports Unicode code points which can be represented by 16-bit values.
The escape is case-insensitive (so, it can also be u+0020, and hex digits A-F can be uppercase or lowercase).

Same as for mnemonics, the Unicode escape is preserved in the configuration.
A Unicode escape may be normalized to the uppercase variant when writing the XML config.footnote:[
The current implementation preserves case, but this may change in a future release.
In other words, the current case-preserving behaviour is not guaranteed under this specification.]

=== XML Escape

In addition, XML by specification supports XML numeric character references (e.g. `++&#xhhhh;++` and `++&#nnnn;++`), and the following five character entities `++&amp;++`, `++&lt;++`, `++&gt;++`, `++&apos;++`, and `++&quot;++`.
These are only available in XML as they are supported/provided by XML itself.
