== Status

* Published: 2024-10-01
* Proposed for: 3.0

== Type

* Feature-Specification

== Context

At time of writing, 2024-10-01, Java 21 is the latest LTS of Java.
Since Java 17, a lot of new features have been added, specifically for _ext-table-gen_, https://openjdk.org/jeps/441["`JEP 441: Pattern Matching for Switch`"^] seems very useful.

As _ext-table_gen_ is a commandline tool, and not a library, it doesn't really need to support a wide-range of versions.

== Decision

Starting with _ext-table-gen_ 3.0, Java 21 is the minimum supported version.

== Consequences

Starting with _ext-table-gen_ 3.0, support for version before Java 21 will no longer be available.
Users who cannot upgrade to Java 21 will need to continue to use _ext-table-gen_ 2.0 (which supports Java 17 or higher).
