== Running the build

To produce the _ext-table-gen_ application, use

[listing]
----
> ./gradlew assemble
----

To run all tests (including integration tests), use:

[listing]
----
> ./gradlew check
----

=== Integration test configuration

The integration tests require some additional configuration.
First of all, it needs a localhost Firebird server.

Create a file called `integration-test-local.properties` in the root of the project (i.e. containing `gradlew`) with content like:

[listing]
----
test.db.host=localhost
test.db.port=3050
test.db.user=sysdba
test.db.password=masterkey
test.db.root-path=E:\\DB\\test-db
test.db.ext-table-dir=E:\\DB\\exttables\\test-data
----

The `test.db.user` must have the `CREATE DATABASE` privilege.
Firebird server must be able to create databases in the path of `test.db.root-path`.
The `ExternalFileAccess` setting of Firebird server must allow access to the path of `test.db.ext-table-dir`.

In theory, a remote Firebird server could also work, but due to the configuration of _ext-table-gen_ and the tests, this would require the `test.db.ext-table-dir` to be a local path which maps to the remote file system, while for the Firebird server, that path is the same value locally.
In practice, we think it will be simpler to just use a local Firebird server.

== Commit hooks

This project comes with a commit hook configuration in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

To use it, install `pre-commit`:

[listing]
----
pip install pre-commit
----

See https://pre-commit.com/[^] for more details.

Then -- from the repository root -- install the pre-commit hook:

[listing]
----
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
----
