The "`Firebird External Table Generator`" or _ext-table-gen_ is a commandline tool to convert {link-rfc4180}[RFC 4180^] CSV files and CSV files with custom formats to https://www.firebirdsql.org/[Firebird^] external tables (a binary format for Firebird external table data).

External tables are a good way for bulk-loading data into Firebird.
Unfortunately, external tables use a fixed-width _binary_ formatfootnote:[The format is essentially the in-memory layout of rows which Firebird also uses internally], and not a (more) standard format like CSV.
It is not always easy to create an appropriate external table file, and this is where _ext-table-gen_ can be used.

At a high level, _ext-table-gen_ provides the following features:

* Derive a `CHAR`-based external table definition (i.e. a `CREATE TABLE` statement and a configuration for _ext-table-gen_) from a CSV file
* Transform a CSV file to an external table file (either based on the CSV file itself, or based on a configuration file)

By default, _ext-table-gen_ derives tables with only `CHAR` columns.
This makes the generated file essentially a fixed-width text format.
However, you can modify the configuration file to make _ext-table-gen_ generate columns of different types, in which case the file becomes a binary format.
_ext-table-gen_ supports the following types of columns:

* String types:
** `char`
* Integral number types:
** `smallint`
** `integer`
** `bigint`
** `int128`
* Exact numeric types (fixed point):
** `numeric`
** `decimal`
* Datetime types:
** `date`
** `time` (without time zone)
** `timestamp` (without time zone)

This user manual provides examples of use, and serves as reference documentation for the commandline options and XML format.
