The "`Firebird External Table Generator`" or _ext-table-gen_ is a commandline tool to convert {link-rfc4180}[RFC 4180^] CSV files to https://www.firebirdsql.org/[Firebird^] external tables (a binary format for Firebird external table data).

External tables are a good way for bulk-loading data into Firebird.
Unfortunately, external tables use a fixed-width _binary_ formatfootnote:[The format is essentially the in-memory layout of rows which Firebird also uses internally], and not a (more) standard format like CSV.
It is not always easy to create an appropriate external table file, and this is where _ext-table-gen_ can be used.

At a high level, _ext-table-gen_ provides the following features:

* Derive a `CHAR`-based external table definition (i.e. a `CREATE TABLE` statement and a configuration for _ext-table-gen_) from a CSV file
* Transform a CSV file to an external table file (either based on the CSV file itself, or based on a configuration file)

// TODO Revise when all integral types are added
The current version only supports `CHAR` columns, which makes the generated file essentially a fixed-width text format.
Future versions may introduce support for additional column types.

This user manual provides examples of use, and serves as reference documentation for the commandline options and XML format.
